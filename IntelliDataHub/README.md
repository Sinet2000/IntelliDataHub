SmartDataHub ML: A Personal Data Management and Scheduling App

SmartDataHub ML is a personal data management and scheduling app that helps users to store and access their data in one easily accessible place, and also uses smart algorithms and machine learning to automatically update their schedule.

The app is built with a React frontend, and .NET microservices on the backend. It utilizes RabbitMQ for communication between microservices, and GraphQL for the API. SmartDataHub ML is designed to be highly modular and scalable, making it easy to add new features and integrations in the future.

With SmartDataHub ML, you'll be able to:

    Store and access all your data in one place
    Automatically update your schedule using advanced algorithms and ML
    Easily share your data with others
    Customize and extend the app to fit your needs
